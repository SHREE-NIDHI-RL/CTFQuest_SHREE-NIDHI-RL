#CHALLENGE TITLE : KEEP WALKING 
#AUTHOR NAME : SHREE NIDHI RL
#CATEGORY : Forensics
#Description : Everything you need is aldready there .Whether you find it depends it depends on the order you look.
#LEVEL : Medium 



When a player opens the challenge, they are given one zip file. After extracting it, they see three files:
1.evidence.png
2.audio.zip
3.image.zip

STEP 1: Checking evidence.png
 
The  first step is to inspect the image.If the player tries normal things like opening the image or running strings,nothing useful comes up.
This makes them to check metadata.When the metadata of evidence.png is inspected using a tool like exiftool, players see a message saying that this is not the flag.

STEP 2: Verifying the evidence file instead of trusting it

As challenge name is about verification, the next thing to do is hash the file.
The player calculates the SHA-256 hash of evidence.png.The hash  is not just a check, but is actually used as a password.
When the player tries that SHA-256 hash as the password for audio.zip, it  opens successfully.

SREP 3: Decoding the audio clue
The audio.zip  is AES-256 encrypted. Inside audio.zip,there is a single audio file.
When the player listens carefully ,the audio  says letters of a English word.
It gives a  keyword:IMAGEKEY
This keyword  need to be used.

STEP  4: Unlocking image.zip

Using the decoded  keyword IMAGEKEY as the password, the player can extract image.zip.
Inside this zip, there are three things:
stnemgarf.jpg
README.txt
verify.dat
The image stnemgarf.jpg shows a fragmented 2 pieces of glass which gives a hint that the flag is splitted.

STEP 5: Getting the first half of the flag from the image

When the metadata of stnemgarf.jpg is inspected, a  encoded string appears in the description field.That string is a encoded Base64URL.
The correct way to solve this part is:
Decode the Base64 value.
Take the decoded result and apply reverse ROT-8.
After doing both steps, the player gets the first half of the flag:
SECE{trust_
This confirms that the solution is on the right path, but the flag is still incomplete.

STEP 6: Understanding the hint in README.txt

The README file does not contain any direct flag text. Instead, it contains a short message talking about:
verification, numbers, interpretation, adding things up correctly.
This is  to guide the player toward the remaining file.

STEP 7: Extracting the second half from verify.dat

When the contents of verify.dat are viewed, the player sees a series of hexadecimal numbers .By interpreting these hex values as ASCII characters , the hidden message can be found :
but_verify}
This gives the second half of the flag.

STEP 8:Reconstruction of flag

First half:
SECE{trust_

Second half:
but_verify}

Putting both together gives the final flag:

SECE{trust_but_verify}

(Instead of extracting the files  through default windows option use tools like 7zip)
